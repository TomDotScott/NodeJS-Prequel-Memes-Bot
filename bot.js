	'WATTO : ...but what would the boy ride? He smashed up my Pod in the last race. It will take some time to fix it. -  Episode 1',
	'ANAKIN : Ahhhh....it wasn’t my fault really...Sebulba flashed me with his vent ports. I actually saved the Pod...mostly. -  Episode 1',
	'WATTO : That you did. The boy is good, no doubts there. -  Episode 1',
	'QUI-GON : I have...acquired a Pod in a game of chance. "The fastest ever built." -  Episode 1',
	'WATTO : I hope you didn’t kill anyone I know for it. So, you supply the Pod and the entry fee; I supply the boy. We split the winnings fifty-fifty, I think. -  Episode 1',
	'QUI-GON : Fifty-fifty!?! If it’s going to be fifty-fifty, I suggest you front the cash for the entry. If we win, you keep all the winnings, minus the cost of the parts I need...If we lose, you keep my ship. -  Episode 1',

	'QUI-GON : You should be proud of your son. He gives without any thought of reward. -  Episode 1',
	'SHMI : He knows nothing of greed. He has... -  Episode 1',
	'QUI-GON : He has special powers. -  Episode 1',
	'SHMI : Yes... -  Episode 1',
	'QUI-GON : He can see things before they happen. That’s why he appears to have such quick reflexes. It is a Jedi trait. -  Episode 1',
	'SHMI : He deserves better than a slave’s life. -  Episode 1',
	'QUI-GON : The Force is unusally strong with him, that much is clear. Who was his father? -  Episode 1',
	'SHMI : There was no father, that I know of...I carried him, I gave him birth...I can’t explain what happened. Can you help him? -  Episode 1',
	'QUI-GON : I’m afraid not. Had he been born in the Republic, we would have identified him early, and he would have become Jedi, no doubt...he has the way. But it’s too late for him now, he’s too old. -  Episode 1',

	'OBI-WAN : Something must be wrong with the transmission. -  Episode 1',
	'QUI-GON : Here’s a signal check. -  Episode 1',
	'OBI-WAN : Strange. The transmission seems to be in good order, but the reading’s off the chart...over twenty thousand. -  Episode 1',
	'QUI-GON : That’s it then. -  Episode 1',

	'WATTO : Not if your ship belongs to me, I think...I warn you, no funny business. -  Episode 1',
	'QUI-GON : You don’t think Anakin will win? -  Episode 1',
	'WATTO : Don’t get me wrongo. I have great faith in the boy. He’s a credit to your race, but Sebulba there is going to win, I think. -  Episode 1',
	'QUI-GON : Why? -  Episode 1',
	'WATTO : He always wins. I’m betting heavily on Sebulba. -  Episode 1',

	'PALPATINE :  This grievous blow is especially personal to me. Before I became Chancellor, I served Amidala when she was Queen. She was a great leader who fought for justice, not only in this honourable assembly, but also on her home planet. She was so loved she could have been elected queen for life. She believed in public service, and she fervently believed in democracy. Her death is a great loss to us all. We will all mourn her as a relentless champion of freedom... and as a dear friend. -  Episode 2',
	'SENATOR ASK AAK : How many more Senators will die before this civil strife ends! We must confront these rebels now, and they need an army to do it. -  Episode 2',

	'ORN FREE TAA : The Republic needs more security now! Before it comes to war. -  Episode 2',
	'PALPATINE : Must I remind the Senator from Malastare that negotiations are continuing with the separatists. Peace is our objective here... not war. -  Episode 2',
	'AMIDALA : My noble colleagues, I concur with the Supreme Chancellor. At all costs, we do not want war! -  Episode 2',
	'PALPATINE : It is with great surprise and joy the chair recognises the Senator from Naboo, Padmé Amidala. -  Episode 2',
	'PADMÉ : Less than an hour ago, an assassination attempt was made against my life. One of my bodyguards and six  others were ruthlessly and senselessly murdered. I was the target but, more importantly, I believe this security measure before you, was the target. I have led the opposition to build an army... but there is someone in this body who will stop at nothing to assure it’s passage... -  Episode 2',
	'PADMÉ :   I warn you, if you vote to create this army, war will follow. I have experienced the misery of war  first-hand; I do not wish to do it again. -  Episode 2',
	'PADMÉ : Wake up, Senators... you must wake up! If you offer the separatists violence, they can only show us violence in return! Many will lose their lives. All will lose their freedom. This decision could very well destroy the very foundation of our great Republic. I pray you do not let fear push you into a disastrous decision. Vote down this security measure, which is nothing less than a declaration of war! Does anyone here want that? I cannot believe they do. -  Episode 2',
	'ORN FREE TAA : My motion to defer the vote must be dealt with first. That is the rule of law. -  Episode 2',
	'PALPATINE : Due to the lateness of the hour and the seriousness of this motion, we will take up these matters tomorrow. Until then, the Senate stands adjourned. -  Episode 2',

	'MACE WINDU : But if they do, you must realise there aren’t enough Jedi to protect the Republic. We are keepers of the peace, not soldiers. -  Episode 2',
	'PALPATINE : Master Yoda, do you think it will really come to war? -  Episode 2',
	'YODA : Worse than war, I fear... Much worse.  -  Episode 2',
	'PALPATINE : What? -  Episode 2',
	'MACE WINDU : What do you sense, Master? -  Episode 2',

	'PADMÉ : Thank you, Master Yoda. Do you have any idea who was behind the attack? -  Episode 2',
	'MACE WINDU : Our intelligence points to disgruntled spice miners, on the moons of Naboo. -  Episode 2',
	'PADMÉ : I don’t wish to disagree but I think that Count Dooku was behind it. -  Episode 2',
	'MACE WINDU : You know, M’Lady, Count Dooku was once a Jedi. He wouldn’t assassinate anyone, it is not in his character. -  Episode 2',
	'KI-ADI-MUNDI : He is a political idealist, not a murderer. -  Episode 2',
	'YODA : In dark times nothing is what it appears to be, but the fact remains Senator, in grave danger you are. -  Episode 2',
	'PALPATINE : Count Dooku has always avoided any kind of conflict. It appears he has no desire to start a war. Why would he kill you? To what end? -  Episode 2',
	'PADMÉ  : I don’t know, but everything in my being tells me he was behind it...  -  Episode 2',
	'PALPATINE : Master Jedi, may I suggest that the Senator be placed under the protection of your graces. -  Episode 2',

	'PADMÉ : Chancellor, if I may comment, I do not believe the... -  Episode 2',
	'PALPATINE : ..."situation is that serious." No, but I do, Senator. -  Episode 2',
	'PADMÉ : Chancellor, please! I don’t want any more guards! -  Episode 2',
	'PALPATINE : I realise all too well that additional security might be disruptive for you, but perhaps someone you are familiar with... an old friend like... Master Kenobi... -  Episode 2',
	'MACE WINDU : That’s possible. He has just returned from a Border dispute on Ansion. -  Episode 2',
	'PALPATINE : You must remember him, M’Lady... he watched over you during the blockade conflict. -  Episode 2',
	'PADMÉ : This is not necessary, Chancellor. -  Episode 2',
	'PALPATINE : Do it for me, M’Lady, please. I will rest easier. We had a big scare today. The thought of losing you is unbearable. -  Episode 2',
	'MACE WINDU : I will have Obi-Wan report to you immediately, M’Lady. -  Episode 2',

	'PADMÉ : It has been far too long Master Kenobi. I’m so glad our paths have crossed again... but I must warn you that I think your presence here is unnecessary. -  Episode 2',

	'ANAKIN : I meant in the interest of protecting her, Master, of course. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : We are not going through this exercise again, Anakin. You will pay attention to my lead. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : Why? -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : What??!! -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : Why else do you think we were assigned to her, if not to find the killer? Protection is a job for local security... not Jedi. It’s overkill, Master. Investigation is implied in our mandate. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : We will do as the Council has instructed, and you will learn your place, young one. -  Episode 2',
	'PADMÉ : Perhaps with merely your presence, the mysteries surrounding this threat will be revealed.  Now if you will excuse me I will retire. -  Episode 2',

	'MACE WINDU : Why couldn’t we see this attack on the Senator? -  Episode 2',
	'YODA : Masking the future, is this disturbance in the Force. -  Episode 2',
	'MACE WINDU : The propecy is coming true, the Dark Side is growing. -  Episode 2',
	'YODA : And only those who have turned to the Dark Side can sense the possibilities of the future. Only going through the Dark Side can we see. -  Episode 2',
	'MACE WINDU : It’s been ten years, and the Sith still have no shown themselves. Do you think they are behind this? -  Episode 2',

	'OBI-WAN : What’s going on? -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : She covered that camera. I don’t think she liked me watching her. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : What is she thinking? -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : She programmed Artoo to warn us if there’s an intruder. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : It’s not an intruder I’m worried about. There are many other ways to kill a Senator. -  Episode 2',

	'OBI-WAN : You’re using her as bait?? -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : It was her idea... No harm will come to her. I can sense everything going on in that room. Trust me. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : It’s too risky... and your senses aren’t that attuned, young apprentice. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : And yours are? -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : Possibly. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN  : You look tired. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : I don’t sleep well, anymore. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN  : Because of your mother? -  Episode 2',

	'OBI-WAN : Dreams pass in time. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : I’d rather dream of Padmé. Just Being around her again is... intoxicating. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : Mind your thoughts, Anakin, they betray you. You’ve made a commitment to the Jedi order... a commitment not easily broken... and don’t forget she’s a politician. They’re not to be trusted. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN  : She’s not like the others in the Senate, Master. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : It’s been my experience that Senators are only focused on pleasing those who fund their campaigns... and they are more than willing to forget the niceties of democracy to get those funds. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : Not another lecture, Master. Not on the economics of politics.... It’s too early in the morning... and besides, you’re generalising. The Chancellor doesn’t appear to be corrupt. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : Palpatine’s a politician, I’ve observed that he is very clever at following the passions and prejudices of the Senators. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : I think he is a good man. My instincts are very positive about... -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : I sense it, too. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : Stay here! -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : I have a bad feeling about this. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : That was wacky! I almost lost you in the traffic. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : What took you so long? -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : Oh, you know, Master, I couldn’t find a speeder I really liked, with an open cockpit... and with the right speed capabilities... and then you know I had to get a really gonzo color... -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : If you’d spend as much time working on your saber skills as you do on your wit, young Padawan, you would rival Master Yoda as a swordsman. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : I thought I already did. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : Only in your mind, my very young apprentice. Careful!! Hey, easy!! -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : Sorry, I forgot you don’t like flying, Master. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : I don’t mind flying... but what you’re doing is suicide! -  Episode 2',

	'ANAKIN : Sorry, Master! -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN :  Oh, that was good... -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : That was crazy!!! -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN :  Ahh, damn. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : Stop!! -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : No, we can make it. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : I’m crazy... I’m crazy... I’m crazy. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : But it worked... we made it. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN :  It didn’t work... we’ve stalled! And you almost got us killed! -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : I think we’re still alive. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN :  It was stupid! -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN :  I could have made it... -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN :  But you didn’t!!! And now we’ve lost him. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : No we didn’t... -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : Where are you going?! He went down there, the other way. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : This is a shortcut... I think. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : What do you mean, ‘You think?’ What kind of shortcut?! He went completely the other way! You’ve lost him! -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : Master, if we keep this chase going, that creep’s gonna end up deep fried. Personally, I’d very much like to find out who in the hell he is and who he’s working for... -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN :  Oh, so that’s why we’re going in the wrong direction. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN :  Well, you lost him. -  Episode 2',

	'ANAKIN : I try, Master. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : Why do I think you are going to be the death of me?! -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : Don’t say that Master... You’re the closest thing I have to a father... I love you. I don’t want to cause you pain. -  Episode 2',

	'PADMÉ : You were just a little boy then. It may not be as you remember it; time changes your perception. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : I think time has given me much more mature feelings to enhance my perception. -  Episode 2',
	'PADMÉ : It must be difficult having sworn your life to the Jedi... not being able to visit the places you like... or do the things you like... -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : Or be with the people I love. -  Episode 2',
	'PADMÉ : Are you allowed to love? I thought that was forbidden for a Jedi. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : Attachment is forbidden. Possession is forbidden. Compassion, which I would define as unconditional love, is central to a Jedi’s life, so you might say we’re encouraged to love. -  Episode 2',
	'PADMÉ : You have changed so much -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : You haven’t changed a bit. You’re exactly the way I remember you in my dreams. I doubt if Naboo has changed much either. -  Episode 2',

	'DEXTER JETTSTER :  I ain’t seen one of these since I was prospecting on Subterrel beyond the Outer Rim! -  Episode 2',

	'DEXTER JETTSTER : This baby belongs to them cloners. What you got here is a Kamino Kyberdart. -  Episode 2',

	'DEXTER JETTSTER : It’s these funny little cuts on the side give it away... Those analysis droids you’ve got over there only focus on symbols, you know. I should think you Jedi would have more respect for the difference between knowledge and wisdom. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : Well, Dex, if droids could think, we wouldn’t be here, would we? Kamino... doesn’t sound familiar. Is it part of the Republic? -  Episode 2',
	'DEXTER JETTSTER : No, it’s beyond the Outer Rim. I’d say about twelve parsecs outside the Rishi Maze, toward the south. It should be easy to find, even for those droids in your archive to find. Those Kaminoans keep to themselves. They’re cloners. Damned good ones, too. -  Episode 2',

	'ANAKIN : If I grew up here, I don’t think I’d ever leave. -  Episode 2',
	'PADMÉ :  I doubt that. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : No, really. When I started my training, I was very homesick and very lonely. This city and my Mom were the only pleasant things I had to think about... The problem was, the more I thought about my Mom, the worse I felt. But I would feel better if I thought about the palace - the way it shimmers in the sunlight - the way the air always smells of flowers... -  Episode 2',
	'PADMÉ : ...and the soft sound of the distant waterfalls. The first time I saw the Capital, I was very young... I’d never seen a waterfall before. I though they were so beautiful... I never dreamed one day I’d live in the palace. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : Well, tell me, did you dream of power and politics when you were a little girl? -  Episode 2',
	'PADMÉ :  No! That was the last thing I thought of. My dream was to help in the "Refugee Relief Movement." I never thought of running for elected office. But the more history I studied, the more I realised how much good politicians could do. So when I was eight, I joined the "Apprentice Legislators", then later on became a Senatorial advisor, with such a passion that, before I knew it, I was elected Queen. Partly because I scored so high on my education certificate, but for the most part it was my conviction that reform was possible. I wasn’t the youngest Queen ever elected, but now that I think back on it, I’m not sure I was old enough. I’m not sure I was ready. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : The people you served thought you did a good job. I heard they tried to amend the Constitution so you could stay in office. -  Episode 2',
	'PADMÉ : Popular rule is not democracy, Annie. It gives the people what they want, not what they need. And, truthfully, I was relieved when my two terms were up. So were my parents. They worried About me during the blockade and couldn’t wait for it all to be over. Actually, I was hoping to have a family by now... My sisters have the most amazing, wonderful kids... but when the Queen asked me to serve as Senator, I couldn’t refuse her. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : I agree! I think the Republic needs you... I’m glad you chose to serve. I feel things are going to happen in our generation that will change the galaxy in profound ways. -  Episode 2',
	'PADMÉ : I think so too. -  Episode 2',
	'QUEEN JAMILLIA : We’ve been worried about you. I’m so glad you’re safe, Padmé. -  Episode 2',
	'PADMÉ : Thank you, Your Highness. I only Wish I could have served you better by staying on Coruscant for the vote. -  Episode 2',
	'SIO BIBBLE : Given the circumstances, Senator, you know it was the only decision Her Highness could have made. -  Episode 2',
	'QUEEN JAMILLIA : How many systems have joined Count Dooku and the separatists? -  Episode 2',
	'PADMÉ : About two hundred. And more are leaving the Republic every day. If the Senate votes to create an army, I’m sure it’s going to push us into a civil war. -  Episode 2',
	'SIO BIBBLE : It’s unthinkable! There hasn’t been a full-scale war since the formation of the Republic! -  Episode 2',
	'QUEEN JAMILLIA : Do you see any way, through negotiations, to bring the separatists back into the Republic? -  Episode 2',
	'PADMÉ : Not if they feel threatened. The separatists don’t have an army, but if they are provoked, they will move to defend themselves. I’m sure of that. And with no time or money to build an army, my guess is they will turn to the Commerce Guilds or the Trade Federation for help. -  Episode 2',
	'QUEEN JAMILLIA : The armies of commerce! Why has Nothing been done in the Senate to restrain them? -  Episode 2',
	'PADMÉ : I’m afraid that, despite the Chancellor’s best efforts, there are still many bureaucrats, judges, and even Senators on the payrolls of the Guilds. -  Episode 2',
	'SIO BIBBLE : It’s outrageous! After all of those hearings, and the four trials in the Supreme Court, Nute Gunray is still the Viceroy of the Trade Federation. Do those money mongers control everything? -  Episode 2',
	'QUEEN JAMILLIA : Remember, Counsellor, the courts were able to reduce the Federation’s armies. That’s a move in the right direction. -  Episode 2',
	'PADMÉ : There are rumours, Your Highness, that the Federation Army was not reduced as they were ordered. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : The Jedi have not been allowed to investigate. It would be to be too dangerous for the economy, we were told. -  Episode 2',
	'QUEEN JAMILLIA : We must keep our faith in the Republic. The day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose it. -  Episode 2',
	'PADMÉ : Let’s pray that day never comes. -  Episode 2',
	'QUEEN JAMILLIA : In the meantime, we must consider your own safety. -  Episode 2',
	'SIO BIBBLE :  What is your suggestion, Master Jedi? -  Episode 2',
	'PADMÉ : Anakin’s not a Jedi yet, Counsellor. He’s still a Padawan learner. I was thinking... -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN :  Hey, hold on a minute! -  Episode 2',
	'PADMÉ : Excuse me! I was thinking I would stay in the Lake Country. There are some places up there that are very isolated. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : Excuse me?! I am in charge of security here, M’Lady. -  Episode 2',
	'PADMÉ : Annie, my life is at risk, and this is my home. I know it very well... that is why we’re here. I think it would be wise for you to take advantage of my knowledge in this instance. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN :  Sorry, M’Lady. -  Episode 2',
	'SIO BIBBLE :  She is right. The Lake Country is the most remote part of Naboo. Not many people and a clear view of the surrounding terrain. -  Episode 2',
	'QUEEN JAMILLIA : Perfect. It’s settled then. -  Episode 2',
	'QUEEN JAMILLIA :  Padmé, I had an audience with your father yesterday. I told him what was happening. He hopes you will visit your mother before you leave... your family’s very worried about you. -  Episode 2',
	'JOCASTA NU : Did you call for assistance? -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN :  Yes... yes, I did... -  Episode 2',
	'JOCASTA NU : He has a powerful face, doesn’t he? He was one of the most brilliant Jedi I have had the privilege of knowing. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : I never understood why he quit. Only twenty Jedi have ever left the Order. -  Episode 2',
	'JOCASTA NU :  The Lost Twenty... and Count Dooku was the most recent and the most painful. No one likes to talk about it. His leaving was a great loss to the Order. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : What happened? -  Episode 2',
	'JOCASTA NU : Well, one might say, he was always a bit out of step with the decisions of the Council... much like your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN :  Really? -  Episode 2',
	'JOCASTA NU : Oh, yes. They were alike in many ways. Very individual thinkers... idealists... -  Episode 2',
	'JOCASTA NU : (continuing He was always striving to become a more powerful Jedi. He wanted to be the best. With a lightsaber, in the old style of fencing, he had no match. His knowledge of the Force was... unique. In the end, I think he left because he lost faith in the Republic. He believed that politics were corrupt, and he felt the Jedi betrayed themselves by serving the politicians. He always had very high expectations of government. He disappeared for nine or ten years, then he just showed up recently as the head of the separatist movement. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : Interesting... I’m still not sure I understand. -  Episode 2',
	'JOCASTA NU : Well, I’m sure you didn’t call me over here for a history lesson. Are you having a problem, Master Kenobi? -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : Yes, I’m trying to find a planet system called Kamino. It doesn’t seem to show upon any of the archive charts. -  Episode 2',
	'JOCASTA NU : Kamino? It’s not a system I’M familiar with... Let me see... -  Episode 2',
	'JOCASTA NU :  Are you sure you have the right co-ordinates? -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN :  According to my information, it should be in this quadrant somewhere... just south of the Rishi Maze. -  Episode 2',
	'JOCASTA NU : No co-ordinates? It sounds like the kind of directions you’d get from a street tout... some old miner or Furbog trader. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : All three actually. -  Episode 2',
	'JOCASTA NU : Are you sure it exists? -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : Absolutely. -  Episode 2',
	'JOCASTA NU : Let me do a gravitational scan. -  Episode 2',
	'JOCASTA NU : There are some inconsistencies here. Maybe the planet you’re looking for was destroyed. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : Wouldn’t that be on record? -  Episode 2',
	'JOCASTA NU : It ought to be. Unless it was very recent. I hate to say it, but it looks like the system you’re searching for doesn’t exist. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : That’s impossible... perhaps the archives are incomplete. -  Episode 2',
	'JOCASTA NU : The archives are comprehensive and totally secure, my young Jedi. One thing you may be absolutely sure of - if an item does not appear in our records, it does not exist! -  Episode 2',
	'PADME : There’s my house! -  Episode 2',
	'PADME :  What? Don’t say you’re shy! -  Episode 2',

	'SOLA : Hello, Anakin. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : Hello. -  Episode 2',
	'JOBAL : You’re just in time for dinner. I hope you’re hungry, Anakin. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : A little. -  Episode 2',

	'JOBAL :  Honey, it’s so good to see you safe. We were so worried. -  Episode 2',
	'RUWEE : Dear... -  Episode 2',
	'JOBAL : I know, I know... but I had to say it. Now it’s done. -  Episode 2',
	'SOLA : Well, this is exciting! Do you know, Anakin, you’re the first boyfriend my sister’s ever brought home? -  Episode 2',
	'PADME :  Sola!! He isn’t my boyfriend! He’s a Jedi assigned by the Senate to protect me. -  Episode 2',
	'JOVAL : A bodyguard?! Oh, Padme! They didn’t tell us it was that serious! -  Episode 2',
	'PADME : It’s not, Mom, I promise. Anyway, Anakin’s a friend. I’ve known him for years. Remember that little boy who was with the Jedi during the blockade crisis? -  Episode 2',
	'PADME :  He grew up. -  Episode 2',
	'JOBAL : Honey, when are you going to settle down? Haven’t you had enough of that life? I certainly have! -  Episode 2',
	'PADME : Mom, I’m not in any danger. -  Episode 2',
	'RUWEE :  Is she? -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : ...Yes... I’m afraid she is. -  Episode 2',
	'PADME :  But not much. -  Episode 2',
	'RUWEE : Sometimes I wish I’d traveled more... but I must say, I’m happy here. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : Padme tells me you teach at the university? -  Episode 2',
	'RUWEE :  Yes, and before that, I was a builder. I also worked for the Refugee Relief Movement, when I was very young. -  Episode 2',
	'SOLA : Why haven’t you told us about him? -  Episode 2',
	'PADMÉ : What’s there to talk about?  He’s just a boy. -  Episode 2',
	'SOLA : A boy? Have you seen the way he looks at you? -  Episode 2',
	'PADMÉ : Sola - stop it! -  Episode 2',
	'SOLA : It’s obvious he has feelings for you. Are you saying, little baby sister, that you haven’t noticed? -  Episode 2',
	'PADMÉ : I’m not your baby sister, Sola. Anakin and I are friends... our relationship is strictly professional. Mom, would you tell her to stop it? -  Episode 2',
	'SOLA :  Well, maybe you haven’t noticed the way he looks at you. I think you’re afraid to. -  Episode 2',
	'PADMÉ : Cut it out. -  Episode 2',
	'JOBAL : Sola’s just concerned... we all are. -  Episode 2',
	'PADMÉ : Oh, Mom, you’re impossible. What I’m doing is important. -  Episode 2',
	'JOBAL : You’ve done your service, Padmé. It’s time you had a life of your own. You’re missing so much! -  Episode 2',
	'RUWEE : Now tell me, son. How serious is this thing? How much danger is my daughter really in? -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : There have been two attempts on her life. Chances are there’ll be more. My Master is tracking down the assassins. I’m sure he’ll find out who they are. This situation, won’t last long. -  Episode 2',
	'RUWEE : I don’t want anything to happen to her. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : I don’t either. -  Episode 2',
	'PADME : Don’t worry, this won’t take long. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : I just want to get there before dark. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN :  You still live at home. -  Episode 2',
	'PADME : I move around so much, I’ve never had a place of my own. Official residences have no warmth. I feel good here. I feel at home. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : I never had a real home. Home was always where my Mom was. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN :  Is this you? -  Episode 2',
	'PADME : That was when I went with the Relief Group to Shadda-Bi-Boran. Their sun was imploding, and the planet was dying. I was helping to relocate the children. See that little one I’m holding? His name was N’a-kee-tula, which means sweethear. He was so full of  life,. All those kids were. I did everything I could to save him, but he died... they all did. They were never able to adapt... to live off their native planet. -  Episode 2',
	'PADME :  My first day as an Apprentice Legislator. Notice the difference? -  Episode 2',
	'YODA : Don’t think... feel... be as one with the Force. Help you, it will. Younglings - enough! A visitor we have. Welcome him. -  Episode 2',
	'YODA :  Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, meet the mighty Bear Clan. -  Episode 2',
	'CHILDREN : Welcome, Master Obi-Wan! -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : I am sorry to disturb you, Master. -  Episode 2',
	'YODA : What help to you, can I be? -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : I’m looking for a planet described to me by an old friend. I trust him. But the system doesn’t show up on the archive maps. -  Episode 2',
	'YODA : An interesting puzzle. Gather round the map reader, younglings. Master Obi-Wan has lost a planet. Find it, we will try... -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : This is where it ought to be... but it isn’t. Gravity is pulling all the stars in this area inward to this spot. There should be a star here... but there isn’t. -  Episode 2',
	'YODA : Most interesting. Gravity’s silhouette remains, but the star and all its planets have disappeared. How can this be? -  Episode 2',
	'JEDI CHILD JACK : Because someone erased it from the archive memory. -  Episode 2',
	'CHILDREN : That’s right! Yes! That’s what happened! Someone erased it! -  Episode 2',
	'JEDI CHILD MAY : If the planet blew up, the gravity would go away. -  Episode 2',
	'YODA : Truly wonderful, the mind of a child is. Uncluttered. To the centre of the pull of gravity go, and find your planet you will. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : But Master Yoda who could have erased information from the archives? That’s impossible, isn’t it? -  Episode 2',
	'YODA :  Much harder to answer, that question is. -  Episode 2',
	'PADMÉ : When I was in Level Three, we used to come here for school retreat. See that island? We used to swim there every day. I love the water. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : I do too. I guess it comes from growing up on a desert planet. -  Episode 2',
	'PADMÉ : ...We used to lie on the sand and let the sun dry us... and try to guess the names of the birds singing. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : I don’t like sand. It’s coarse and rough and irritating, and it gets everywhere. Not like here. Here everything’s soft... and smooth... -  Episode 2',
	'PADMÉ : There was a very old man who lived on the island. He used to make glass out of sand - and vases and necklaces out of the glass. They were magical. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN :  Everything here is magical. -  Episode 2',
	'PADMÉ : You could look into the glass and see the water. The way it ripples and moves. It looked so real... but it wasn’t. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : Sometimes, when you believe something to be real, it becomes real. Real enough, anyway... -  Episode 2',
	'PADMÉ : I used to think if you looked too deeply into glass, you would lose yourself. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : I think it’s true... -  Episode 2',
	'PADMÉ : I shouldn’t have done that. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : I’m sorry. When I’m around you, my mind is no longer my own. -  Episode 2',
	'PADMÉ : It’s the situation... the stress... -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : ...the view. -  Episode 2',
	'MACE WINDU : Be wary, this disturbance in the Force is growing stronger. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : I am concerned for my Padawan. He is not ready to be on his own. -  Episode 2',
	'YODA : The Council is confident in this decision, Obi-Wan. -  Episode 2',
	'MACE : He has exceptional skills. The Council is confident in its decision, Obi-Wan. If the prophecy is true, he weill be the one to bring balance to the Force. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : But he still has much to learn. And his abilities have made him... well... arrogant. I realise now what you and Master Yoda knew from the beginning... the boy was too old to start the training and... -  Episode 2',
	'MACE WINDU : There’s something else? -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : Master, he should not have been given this assignment. I’m afraid Anakin won’t be able to protect the Senator.  -  Episode 2',
	'MACE WINDU : Why? -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : He has a... an emotional connection with her. It’s been there since he was boy. Now he’s confused... distracted. -  Episode 2',
	'MACE-WINDU : Obi-Wan, you must have faith that he will take the right path. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : Has Master Yoda gained any insight into whether or not this war will come about? -  Episode 2',
	'MACE WINDU : Probing the Dark Side is a dangerous process. He could be in seclusion for days... May the force be with you. -  Episode 2',
	'PADME : You did that? -  Episode 2',

	'PADME : That! Now stop it! -  Episode 2',
	'PADME :  Anakin!! -  Episode 2',

	'PADME : I don’t know. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : Then how can I tell you? -  Episode 2',
	'PADME : Maybe you should use your Jedi intuition. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : It doesn’t work around you. My mind is always a muddle... I can only think of you. -  Episode 2',
	'PADME : Anakin, don’t... -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : From the moment I met you, all those years ago, a day hasn’t gone by when I haven’t thought of you. And now that I’m close to you again, I’m in agony. The closer I get to you, the worse it gets. The thought of not being with you mskes my stomach turn over - my mouth goes dry. I feel dizzy. I can’t breathe. I’m haunted by the kiss you should never have given me. My heart is beating, hoping that kiss will not become a scar. You are in my very soul, tormenting me. What can I do? I will do anything you ask... -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN :  If you are suffering as much as I am, tell me. -  Episode 2',

	'ANAKIN : Anything’s possible. Padme, please listen... -  Episode 2',
	'PADME : You listen. We live in a real world. Come back to it. You’re studying to become a Jedi Knight. I’m a Senator. If you follow your thoughts through to conclusion, they will take us to a place we cannot go... regardless of the way we feel about each other. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : Then you do feel something! There’s an extraordinary connection between us. You can’t deny that. -  Episode 2',
	'PADME : Annie, it doesn’t make any difference. Jedi aren’t allowed to marry. You swore an oath, remember? You’d be expelled from the Order. I will not let you give up your responsibilities... your future, for me. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : I was destined to be a Jedi. I don’t think I could be anything else. But you are asking me to be rational. That is something I know I cannot do. I wish I could wish my feelings away... but I can’t. -  Episode 2',
	'PADME : I am not going to give into this. I’m not going to throw my life away. I have more important things to do than fall in love. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : It wouldn’t have to be that way... we could keep it a secret. -  Episode 2',
	'PADME : Then we’d be living a lie - one we couldn’t keep even if we wanted to. Mt sister saw it. So did my mother. I couldn’t do that. Could you, Anakin? Could you live like that? -  Episode 2',

	'TAUN WE : Everything is ready. The Prime Minister expects you. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN :  I’m expected? -  Episode 2',
	'TAUN WE : Of course! He is anxious to see you. After all these years, we were beginning to think you weren’t coming. Now please, this -  Episode 2',
	'way!TAUN WE : May I present Lama Su, Prime Minister of Kamino... and this is Master Jedi... -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : Obi-Wan Kenobi. -  Episode 2',
	'LAMA SU : Please... -  Episode 2',
	'LAMA SU : I trust you are going to enjoy your stay. We are most happy you have arrived at the best part of the season. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : You make me feel most welcome. -  Episode 2',
	'LAMA SU : And now to business. You will be delighted to hear we are on schedule. Two hundred thousand units are ready, with another million well on the way. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN :  That is... good news. -  Episode 2',
	'LAMA SU : Please tell your Master Sido-Dyas that we have every confidence his order will be met on time and in full. He is well, I hope? -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : I’m sorry Master - ? -  Episode 2',
	'LAMA SU : Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas. He’s still a leading member of the Jedi Council, is he not? -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : Oh, yes. Sido-Dyas. -  Episode 2',
	'LAMA SU :  You must be anxious to inspect the units for yourself. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : That’s why I’m here. -  Episode 2',
	'PADMÉ : I don’t know... -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : Sure you do... you just don’t want to tell me. -  Episode 2',
	'PADMÉ : Are you going to use one of your Jedi mind tricks on me? -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : They only work on the weak-minded. You are anything but weak-minded. -  Episode 2',
	'PADMÉ : All right... his name was Palo. I was twelve. We were both in the Legislative Youth Program. He was a few years older then I... very cute... dark curly hair... dreamy eyes. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : All right, I get the picture... whatever happened to him? -  Episode 2',
	'PADMÉ : I went on to become a Queen. He went on to become an artist. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : Maybe he was the smart one. -  Episode 2',
	'PADME : You really don’t like politicians, do you? -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : I like two or three, but I’m not really sure about one of them. I don’t think the system works. -  Episode 2',
	'PADME : How would you have it work? -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : We need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problems, agree what’s in the best interests of all the people, and then do it. -  Episode 2',
	'PADME : That is exactly what we do. The trouble is that people don’t wlways agree. In fact, they hardly ever do. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : Then they should be made to. -  Episode 2',
	'PADME : By whom? Who’s going to make them? -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : I don’t know. Someone. -  Episode 2',
	'PADME : You? -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : Of course not me. -  Episode 2',
	'PADME : But someone. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : Someone wise. -  Episode 2',
	'PADME : That sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : Well, if it works... -  Episode 2',
	'PADMÉ : You’re making fun of me. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN :   On no, I’d be much too frightened to tease a Senator. -  Episode 2',
	'PADMÉ : You’re so bad! -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : You’re always so serious. Always carrying the weight of the universe on your shoulders. -  Episode 2',
	'LAMA SU :  Magnificent, aren’t they? -  Episode 2',
	'LAMA SU : We modified their genetic structure to make them less independent than the original host. As a result they are totally obedient, taking any order without question. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAM : Who was the original host? -  Episode 2',
	'LAMA SU : A bounty hunter called Jango Fett. We felt a Jedi would be the perfect choice, but Sido-Dyas hand- picked Jango Fett himself. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : Where is this bounty hunter now? -  Episode 2',
	'LAMA SU : Oh, we keep him here. After a few hundred thousand clones, the genetic pattern starts to fade, so we take a fresh supply. He lives here, but he’s free to come and go as he pleases. -  Episode 2',
	'LAMA SU : Apart from his pay, which is considerable, Fett demanded only one thing - an unaltered clone for himself. Curious isn’t it? -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : Unaltered? -  Episode 2',
	'LAMA SU : Pure genetic replication. No tampering with the structure to make it more docile... and no growth acceleration... -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : I would like to meet this Jango Fett. -  Episode 2',
	'TAUN WE : I would be most happy to arrange it, for you. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : You mentioned growth acceleration... -  Episode 2',
	'LAMA SU : Oh yes, it’s essential. Otherwise, a mature clone would take a lifetime to grow. Now, we can do it in half the time. Those items you saw on the parade ground were started ten years ago, when Sido-dyas first placed the order, and they’re already mature... -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : And these? -  Episode 2',
	'LAMA SU : About five years ago. -  Episode 2',
	'LAMA SU : They’re immensely superior to droids, capable of independent thought and action. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : Very impressive. -  Episode 2',
	'LAMA SU : I’d hoped you would be pleased.  -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN :  Tell me, prime minister, when my Master Sido-dyas first contacted you, did he say the order was for... himself... or? -  Episode 2',
	'LAMA SU : Himself? Of course not. This army is for the Republic? -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN :  The Repubic? -  Episode 2',
	'LAMA SU : We are also very much agasint this Count Dooku and his seccessionist movement. We are proud to be of help to the Republic. -  Episode 2',
	'TAUN WE : I have arranged for you to meet Jango Fett in the morning. Sleep well. -  Episode 2',

	'OBI-WAN : Arfour, relay this, "scramble code -  Episode 2',
	'five," to Courscant: care of "the old folks home." -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN  : ...I’ve never heard of a Jedi called Sido-Dyas, have you, Master? -  Episode 2',
	'MACE WINDU : No. Whoever placed that order was not a Jedi, I can assure you. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN  : I have a strong feeling that this bounty hunter is the assassin we’re looking for. -  Episode 2',
	'YODA : Who he is working for... discover that, you must. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN  : I will, Master, and I will also find out more about this clone army... May The Force... -  Episode 2',
	'WINDU  : A clone army! Ordered by someone in the Senate perhaps... Someone’s out to start a war. -  Episode 2',
	'YODA : Inform the chancellor of this, we must. -  Episode 2',
	'WINDU : Who do you think this impostor Sido-Dyas, could be? -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : No...No...No...Mom!...Don’t, no, don’t! -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN :  Don’t go. -  Episode 2',
	'PAMDE : I don’t want to disturb you. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : Your presence is soothing. -  Episode 2',
	'PADME : You had a nightmare again last night. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : Jedi don’t have nightmares. -  Episode 2',
	'PADME : I heard you. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : I saw my mother. I saw her as clearly as I see you now. She’s suffering, Padme. She is in pain...They’re killing her! I know I’m disobeying my mandate to protect you, Senator. I know I will be punished and possibly thrown out of the Jedi Order, but I must go. I have to help her! I’m sorry, Padme. I don’t have a choice. -  Episode 2',
	'PADME : Annie, I told you I wouldn’t let you give up your future for me. I’ll go with you. That way you can continue to protect me, and you won’t be disobeying your mandate. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : What about Master Obi-wan? -  Episode 2',
	'PADME : I guess we won’t tell him, will we?TAUN WE : Boba, is your father here? -  Episode 2',
	'TAUN WE :  May we see him? -  Episode 2',
	'BOBA FETT : Sure. -  Episode 2',
	'BOBA FETT : Dad! Taun We’s here! -  Episode 2',
	'TAUN WE : Welcome back, Jango. Was your trip productive? -  Episode 2',
	'JANGO FETT : Fairly. -  Episode 2',
	'TAUN WE : This is Jedi Master, Obi-Wan Kenobi. He’s come to check on our progress. -  Episode 2',
	'JANGO FETT : That right? -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : Your clones are very impressive. You must be very proud. -  Episode 2',
	'JANGO FETT : I’m just a simple man, trying to make my way in the universe, Master Jedi. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : Aren’t we all? -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN :  Ever made your way as far into the interior as Coruscant? -  Episode 2',
	'JANGO : Once or twice. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : Recently? -  Episode 2',
	'JANGO :  Possibly... -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : Then you must know Master Sido- Dyas? -  Episode 2',
	'JANGO : Boba, close the door. -  Episode 2',
	'JANGO :  Master who? -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : Sido-Dyas. Isn’t he the Jedi who hired you for this job? -  Episode 2',
	'JANGO : Never heard of him. I was recuited by a man called Darth Tyranus on one of the moons of Bogden. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : No? I thought... -  Episode 2',
	'TAUN WE : Sido-Dyas told us to expect him. And he showed up just when your Jedi Master said he would. We have kept the Jedi’s involvement a secret until your arrival, just as your Master requested. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : Curious... -  Episode 2',
	'JANGO : Do you like your army? -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : It seems to me it’s your army - being that they are all clones of you. -  Episode 2',
	'JANGO :  They’ll do their job well, I’ll guarantee that. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : I look forward to seeing them in action. Thank you for your time, Jango. -  Episode 2',
	'JANGO : Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi. -  Episode 2',
	'BOBA : What is it, Dad? -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN :  Wait, please. -  Episode 2',
	'WATTO :  No, not that one - that one! -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN :  Excuse me, Watto. -  Episode 2',
	'WATTO :  What? -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN :  I said excuse me. -  Episode 2',
	'WATTO :  Shut down. -  Episode 2',
	'WATTO :  What? I don’t know you... What can I do for you? You look like a Jedi. Whatever it is... I didn’t do it. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : Let me help you with that. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN :  I’m looking for Shmi Skywalker. -  Episode 2',
	'WATTO : Annie?? Little Annie?? Naaaah!! -  Episode 2',
	'WATTO :  You are Annie! It is you! You little womp rat. -  Episode 2',
	'WATTO :  You sure sprouted Weehoo! A Jedi! Waddya know? Hey, maybe you couldda help wit some daedbeats who owe... -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : My mother... -  Episode 2',
	'WATTO : Oh, yeah. Shmi... she’s not mine no more. I sold her. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : Sold her... -  Episode 2',
	'WATTO : Years ago. Sorry, Anne, but you know, business is business. Sold her to a moisture farmer named Lars. Least I think it was Lars. Believe it or not, I heard he freed her and married her. Can ya beat that? -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : Do you know where they are? -  Episode 2',
	'WATTO : Long way from here... someplace over on the other side of Mos Eisley, I think... -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : I’d like to know. -  Episode 2',
	'WATTO : Yeah... sure... absolutely. Let’s go look in my records. -  Episode 2',
	'LAMA SU : Tell your Council the first battalions are ready. And remind them that if they need more troops, we will need time to grow them. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : I won’t forget.BOBA FETT : Dad!!PADME : Stay with the ship, Artoo. -  Episode 2',
	'C-3PO : Good evening. May I help you? -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : Threepio? -  Episode 2',
	'C-3PO : Oh, my... oh, my! Master Anakin! My goodness, I can hardly believe it! And this must be Miss Padme. -  Episode 2',
	'PADME : Hello, Threepio. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : I’ve come to see my mother. -  Episode 2',
	'C-3PO : Oh, dear! I’m so terribly sorry, Master Annie. -  Episode 2',
	'PADME : Threepio, what’s happened? -  Episode 2',
	'C-3PO : I think we’d better go inside. -  Episode 2',
	'C-3PO : Master Lars - Master Owen! Somebody to see you! -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : I’m Anakin Skywalker. I’m here looking for my mother. -  Episode 2',
	'OWEN : Owen Lars... I guess I’m your step-brother. This is my girlfriend, Beru. -  Episode 2',
	'BERU : Hello. -  Episode 2',
	'PADME : I’m Padme. -  Episode 2',
	'OWEN : I had a feeling you might show up some day. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : Is my mother here? -  Episode 2',
	'CLIEGG : No, she’s not. -  Episode 2',
	'CLIEGG :  Cliegg Lars. Shmi is my wife... Come on inside. We have a lot to talk about. -  Episode 2',
	'CLIEGG  : It was just before dawn. They came out of nowhere. A hunting party of Tusekn Raiders. -  Episode 2',
	'CLIEGG : Your mother had gone out early, like she always did, to pick mushrooms that grow on the vaporatos. From the tracks, she was about halfway when they took her. Those Tuskens walk like men, but they’re vicious, mindless monsters. Thirty of us went out after her. Four of us came back. Three more are still out there looking. I’d be with them, only... I just couldn’t ride any more... until I heal. -  Episode 2',
	'CLIEGG :  This isn’t the way I wanted to meet you, son. This isn’t how your mother and I planned it. I don’t want to give up on her, but she’s been gone a month. There’s little hope she’s lasted this long. -  Episode 2',
	'OWEN : Where are you going? -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : To find my mother. -  Episode 2',
	'PADME : No, Annie! -  Episode 2',
	'CLIEGG : She’s daed, son. Accept it. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : I can feel her pain, and I will find her. I know she’s alive. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : You are going to have to stay here. These are good people, Padme. You’ll be safe. -  Episode 2',
	'OWEN : Take my speeder bike. -  Episode 2',
	'PADME : Anakin... -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : I trust you’ll watch over her, Owen. -  Episode 2',
	'OWEN : Don’t worry. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : I won’t be long. -  Episode 2',
	'JANGO FETT : Nearly there, son. -  Episode 2',
	'BOBA FETT : Dad, look!! -  Episode 2',
	'JANGO FETT : Hang on! -  Episode 2',
	'BOBA FETT : Dad! Watch out! -  Episode 2',
	'JANGO FETT : Stay calm, son. We’ll be fine. That Jedi won’t be able to follow us through this. -  Episode 2',
	'BOBA FETT : Got him! Yeahhhhh! -  Episode 2',
	'JANGO FETT : We won’t see him again.C-3PO : Please don’t leave us, Miss Padme. These people need your help. -  Episode 2',
	'PADME : I’m not leaving, Threepio. I just can’t sleep. -  Episode 2',
	'C-3PO : That’s something I cannot relate to. As a Protocol Droid, I’m either active or inactive. There’s no in-between. -  Episode 2',
	'PADME : I guess you’re lucky. -  Episode 2',
	'C-3PO : Do you really think so..? I suppose I shouldn’t expect... -  Episode 2',
	'PADME : You’re not happy here? -  Episode 2',
	'C-3PO : Oh, I’m not unhappy... and my masters here ar so kind I wouldn’t wish to trouuble them, it’s just... being like this... well, it’s embarrassing. -  Episode 2',
	'PADME : Being like what? -  Episode 2',
	'C-3PO : Naked. If you pardon the expression. You see, when Master Annie made me, he never quite found the time to give me any outer covering. It’s so humiliating. How would you like it if you had to go around with all your circuits showing? -  Episode 2',
	'PADME : I guess I wouldn’t like it at all. -  Episode 2',
	'C-3PO : Of course you wouldn’t. Nobody would. It’s simply not protocol. -  Episode 2',
	'PADME : Maybe we can do something about it. -  Episode 2',
	'C-3PO : I don’t think so. Only Master Annie... -  Episode 2',
	'PADME : Why not? They seem to have a box of old coverings here. -  Episode 2',
	'C-3PO : Oh? How observant of you, Miss Padme. Of course, I’m just not mechanically minded... if you see what I mean. -  Episode 2',
	'PADME : Let’s see, if we put this... here... -  Episode 2',
	'C-3PO : Ooooh! That’s tickles. -  Episode 2',
	'PADME : You’ll have to be quiet, Threepio. Hold still, please. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : Mom... Mom... Mom...  -  Episode 2',
	'SHMI : Annie...? Is it you? -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : I’m here, Mom. You’re safe. Hang on. I’m going to get you out of here... -  Episode 2',
	'SHMI : I’m so glad... to see you, Annie... Now... I am complete... -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : Just stay with me, Mom. I’m going to make you well again. Everything’s going to be fine. -  Episode 2',
	'SHMI : You look so handsome. My son... my grown-up son. I’m so proud of you, Annie... so proud... I missed you so much... I love... -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : "Guiding light" to "old folks home." -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : ...Starships from the Trade Federation and the Commerce Guilds are taking deliveries of battle droids from the foundries on Geonosis. -  Episode 2',
	'BAIL ORGANA : That’s outrageous! The treaty forbids the Trade Federation from building up an army. What are they doing?! -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : The droid foundry seems to be working at full capacity. I am going to go down and investigate. I will bring Jango Fett back home for interrogation. -  Episode 2',
	'PALPATINE : Those Geonosian foundries are part of the Techno Union. We will call in their representatives and ask them a few very pointed questions. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : One more thing. Jango mentioned he was recruited by someone named Darth Tyranus. Any idea who that might be? -  Episode 2',
	'YODA : With the forename Darth, a Sith he must be. -  Episode 2',
	'MACE WINDU : Our missing apprentice. They are playing their hand at last. -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : Do you believe he could be the mysterious Sido-Dyas, who made the deal for the clone army? -  Episode 2',
	'YODA : Perhaps too many pieces are missing from this puzzle, there are. -  Episode 2',
	'MACE WINDU : Be careful, Obi-Wan. This investigation is becoming less than routine. Do you need help? -  Episode 2',
	'OBI-WAN : Let me see if I can figure out what’s going on first. -  Episode 2',
	'BAIL ORGANA : The Commerce Guilds are preparing for war... there can be no doubt of that. -  Episode 2',
	'PALPATINE : Count Dooku must have made a treaty with them. -  Episode 2',
	'MACE WINDU : We must stop them soon before they’re fully ready. -  Episode 2',
	'SENATOR ASK AAK : The debate is over, we need that clone army now! -  Episode 2',
	'BAIL ORGANA : Unfortunately, the debate is not over. The Senate will never be able to approve the use of that army before the separatists attack. -  Episode 2',
	'MAS AMEDDA : This is a crisis! If the Senate votes the Chancellor emergency powers, he could approve the use of the army in a minute. -  Episode 2',
	'PALPATINE : Please, please, I don’t wish to have emergency powers. That’s too extreme a solution. It’s akin to a dictatorship. We must rely on the Jedi. Master Yoda, how many are available to go to Geonosis? -  Episode 2',
	'YODA : Two Hundred,... less or more. -  Episode 2',
	'BAIL ORGANA : With all due respect for the Jedi Order, two hundred will be no match for hundreds of thousands of battle droids. -  Episode 2',
	'MACE WINDU : Patience. We should wait for Obi- Wan to report back. We don’t know that Count Dooku has made a treaty with the Corporate Alliance, it’s speculation. -  Episode 2',
	'SENATOR ASK AAK : But we must prepare for the worst. I’m going to propose a motion granting emergency powers to the Chancellor at the next session. We must not wait! -  Episode 2',
	'PALPATINE : Out of the question, Senator! You and I are too closely aligned. The issue will become partisan and debates will begin. The proposal must come from a neutral source. -  Episode 2',
	'MAS AMEDDA : If only Senator Amidala were here. -  Episode 2',
	'JAR JAR : Supreme Chancellor... my august colleagues, I would be proud to propose the motion in question. This is a grave situation, and I’m sure Senator Amidala, and the Queen of Naboo would agree. -  Episode 2',
	'SENATOR ASK AAK : Thank you, Representative Binks. -  Episode 2',
	'PALPATINE : If called upon, I will serve. But it will be the saddest day of my life. -  Episode 2',
	'PADME : There! -  Episode 2',
	'C-3PO : Um. How do I look? -  Episode 2',
	'OWEN : Great! You look perfect. -  Episode 2',
	'C-3PO : Perfect? Oh, Miss Padme, I’m so happy! Oh, pardon me. -  Episode 2',
	'THREEPIO :  Thank you. -  Episode 2',
	'C-3PO :  Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! -  Episode 2',
	'OWEN :  Well, Padme, I think he should be yours from now on... I know that is what my Mom would want. -  Episode 2',

	'back! He’s back!OBI-WAN : ...Alliance have pledged their armies to Count Dooku and are forming an... Wait!... ah... attack... I don’t... make it... aaaggghhh! -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : I’m going after him! -  Episode 2',
	'PADME : I thought the first thing he said was to retransmit his message to Coruscant. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : Yeah, you’re right, you’re right. -  Episode 2',
	'MACE WINDU : We will deal with Count Dooku. The most important thing for you, Anakin, is to stay where you are. Protect the Senator at all costs. That is your priority. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : Understood, Master. -  Episode 2',
	'PADME : They’ll never get there in time to save him. They have to come half way across the galaxy. Look, Geonosis is less than a parsec away. -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : If he’s still alive. -  Episode 2',
	'PADME : Annie, are you just going to sit here and let him die?? He’s your friend... your mentor... -  Episode 2',
	'ANAKIN : ...He’s like my father, but you heard Master Windu. He gave me strict orders to stay here. -  Episode 2',
	'PADME : He gave you strict orders to protect me... -  Episode 2',
	'PADME :  ...and I’m going to save Obi-Wan. So if you plan to protect me, you will have to come along. -  Episode 2',
	'MACE WINDU : The longer we wait, the stronger Dooku’s armies become. We cannot wait for the Senate to make up its mind about granting the Chancellor emergency powers, in order to be able to use that clone army... We have the authority to go now. We must go now. -  Episode 2',
	'YODA : Agreed, Master Windu. Two hundred Jedi send. Enough, let’s hope they are. -  Episode 2',
	'MAS AMEDDA : Order! Order!! -  Episode 2',

	'MAS AMEDDA : Order! The Senate will accord the Representative the courtesy of a hearing! -  Episode 2',
	'JAR JAR : In response to the direct threat to the Republic from the Confederacy of Independent Systems, I propose that the Senate gives immediate emergency powers to the Supreme Chancellor. -  Episode 2',
	'JAR JAR :  Who can deny these are exceptional times? Exceptional times demand exceptional measures! Exceptional measures demand exceptional men! -  Episode 2',
	'ORN FREE TAA : We won’t support a dictator. -  Episode 2',
	'JAR JAR : That is the sentiment every one of us agrees with! And when the shadow of war has dispersed and the bright day of liberty has dawned once again, the power we now give to the Supreme Chancellor will be gladly, and swiftly returned. Out ancient liberties will be restored to us, burnished even more brightly than before! -  Episode 2',
	'PALPATINE : It is with great reluctance that I have agreed to this calling. I love democracy... I love the Republic. The fact that this crisis is demanding I be given absolute power to tule over you is evident. But I am mild by nature and have no desire to destroy the democratic process.

It’s purely personal, and they have already paid great sums to have you assassinated. I’m sure they will push hard to have you included in the executions.

	'OBI-WAN: Well, Artoo has been . . .  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: No loose wire jokes . . . He’s doing the best he can.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Did I say anything?  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: He’s trying!  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: I didn’t say anything!  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Chancellor.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Are you all right?  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: Count Dooku.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: This time we will do it together.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: I was about to say that.  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: Get help! You’re no match for him. He’s a Sith Lord.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Chancellor Palpatine, Sith Lords are our specialty.  -  Episode 3',
	'COUNT DOOKU: Your swords, please, Master Jedi. We don’t want to make a mess of things in front of the Chancellor.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: You won’t get away this time, Dooku.  -  Episode 3',
	'COUNT DOOKU: I’ve been looking forward to this.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: My powers have doubled since the last time we met, Count.  -  Episode 3',
	'COUNT DOOKU: Good. Twice the pride, double the fall.  -  Episode 3',
	'COUNT DOOKU: Your moves are clumsy, Kenobi . . . too predictable. You’ll have to do better.  -  Episode 3',
	'COUNT DOOKU: I sense great fear in you, Skywalker. You have hate, you have anger, but you don’t use them.  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: Good, Anakin, good. I knew you could do it. Kill him. Kill him now!  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: I shouldn’t . . .  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: Do it!!  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: ... I couldn’t stop myself.  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: You did well, Anakin. He was too dangerous to be kept alive.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: I shouldn’t have done that, Chancellor. It’s not the Jedi way.  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: It is only natural. He cut off your arm, and you wanted revenge. It wasn’t the first time, Anakin. Remember what you told me about your mother and the Sand People. Now, we must leave before more security droids arrive.  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: Anakin, there is no time. We must get off the ship before it’s too late.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: He seems to be all right. No broken bones, breathing’s all right.  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: Leave him, or we’ll never make it.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: His fate will be the same as ours.  -  Episode 3',
	'GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Prepare for attack.  -  Episode 3',
	'PILOT: All batteries fire! Fire!  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: The elevator’s not working, Artoo . . .  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: . . . Activate Elevator 3224.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Artoo ... do you copy? Artoo, come in!  -  Episode 3',
	'PILOT: Reverse stabilizers.  -  Episode 3',
	'PILOT: Magnetize! Magnetize!  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: We can’t wait. Come on, we have to be fast.  -  Episode 3',
	'GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Fire the emergency booster engines.  -  Episode 3',
	'PILOT: Leveling out, sir.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Easy. . . . We’re in a bit of a situation.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Did I miss something?  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKINN: Hold on.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: What is that?  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Oops.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Artoo, Artoo, shut down the elevator!  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Too late! Jump!  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Let’s see if we can find something in the hangar bay that’s still flyable. Come on.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Artoo, get down here. Artoo, do you copy?  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: None of those ships will get us anywhere.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: I agree.  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: What are we going to do?  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: I don’t know.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Don’t look at me. I don’t know.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Here, Chancellor, lock this around your waist, and hold on.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: We’ll head toward the bridge and see if we can find an escape pod.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN/OBI-WAN: Well, that was close.  -  Episode 3',
	'BODYGUARD: General, we found the Jedi. They’re in hallway 328.  -  Episode 3',
	'GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Activate ray shields.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Ray shields!  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Wait a minute, how’d this happen! We’re smarter than this.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Apparently not, Master. This is the oldest trap in the book . . . Well ... I was distracted.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Oh, so all of a sudden it’s my fault.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: You’re the Master. I’m just a hero.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: I’m open to suggestions here.  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: Why don’t we let them take us to General Grievous. Perhaps with Count Dooku’s demise, we can negotiate our release.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: I say . . . patience.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Patience! That’s your plan, is it?  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Yes, Artoo will be along in a few moments and he’ll release the ray shields . . .  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: See! No problem.  -  Episode 3',
	'SUPER BATTLE DROID: Don’t move, dummy. Ouch! Zap this.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Do you have a plan B?  -  Episode 3',
	'GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Oh yes. General Kenobi, the Negotiator. We’ve been waiting for you. That wasn’t much of a rescue.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: That depends upon your point of view. Hah!  -  Episode 3',
	'GENERAL GRIEVOUS: And Anakin Skywalker ... I was expecting someone with your reputation to be a little older.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: General Grievous . . . Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies. You’re shorter than I expected.  -  Episode 3',
	'GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Ahhhh, Jedi scum . . .  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Anakin, try not to upset him. We have a job to do.  -  Episode 3',
	'GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Your lightsabers will make a fine addition to my collection.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Not this time. And this time you won’t escape.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Artoo.  -  Episode 3',
	'GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Crush them! Make them suffer!  -  Episode 3',
	'GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Stay and watch your stations.  -  Episode 3',
	'PILOT: Sir, we are falling out of orbit. All aft control cells are dead.  -  Episode 3',
	'GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Stay on course . . . Don’t bother with them. Keep the ship in orbit.  -  Episode 3',
	'GENERAL GRIEVOUS: You lose, General Kenobi.  -  Episode 3',
	'PILOT: The ship is breaking up!  -  Episode 3',
	'GENERAL GRIEVOUS: We’ve run out of time.  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: The hull is burning up!  -  Episode 3',
	'GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Time to abandon ship.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: All the escape pods have been launched.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Grievous. Can you fly a cruiser like this?  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: You mean, do I know how to land what’s left of this thing?  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Well?  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Under the circumstances, I’d say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant. Strap yourselves in.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Steady . . . Attitude . . . eighteen degrees.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Pressure rising. We’ve got to slow this wreck down. Open all hatches, extend all flaps, and drag fins.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Temp steady. Hatches open, flaps extended, drag fins . . .  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: We lost something.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Not to worry, we’re still flying half the ship.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Now we’re really picking up speed . . . I’m going to shift a few degrees and see if I can slow us down.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Careful . . . we’re heating up-twelve thousand . . . thirteen thousand . . .  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: What’s our speed?  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Eight plus sixty-forty. Eight plus sixty-twenty. Eight plus sixty. Temp ten thousand, nine thousand . . . we’re in the atmosphere . . .  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Grab that . . . Keep us level.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Steady. Steady.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Easy, Artoo. Hang on, this may get a little rough. We lost our heat shields.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Five thousand. Three thousand . . . two thousand. Fireships on the left and the right.  -  Episode 3',
	'FlRESHIP PILOT: We’ll take you in.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Copy that. Landing strip’s straight ahead.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: We’re coming in too hot.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Easy-easy.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Another happy landing.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Are you coming, Master?  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Oh no. I’m not brave enough for politics. I have to report to the Council. Besides, someone needs to be the poster boy.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Hold on, this whole operation was your idea. You planned it. You led the rescue operation. You have to be the one to take the bows this time.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Sorry, old friend. Let us not forget that you rescued me from the Buzz Droids. And you killed Count Dooku. And you rescued the Chancellor, carrying me unconscious on your back, and you managed to land that bucket of bolts safely . . .  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: All because of your training, Master. You deserve all those speeches of your greatness.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: . . . the endless speeches . . . Anakin, let’s be fair. Today, you are the hero and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: All right. But you owe me . . . and not for saving your skin for the tenth time . . .  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Ninth time . . . that business on Cato Nemoidia doesn’t count. I’ll see you at the briefing.  -  Episode 3',
	'MACE WlNDU: Chancellor Palpatine, what a welcome sight! Are you all right?  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: Yes, thanks to your two Jedi Knights. They killed Count Dooku, but General Grievous has escaped once again.  -  Episode 3',
	'MACE WlNDU: General Grievous will run and hide as he always does. He is a coward.  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: That maybe true, but with Count Dooku dead, he is the leader of the Droid Army, and I assure you, the Senate will vote to continue the war as long as Grievous is alive.  -  Episode 3',
	'MACE WlNDU: Then the Jedi Council will make finding Grievous our highest priority.  -  Episode 3',
	'BAIL ORGANA: Skywalker, the Republic cannot praise you enough.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Thank you, Senator Organa. The kidnapping was a bold move by the Separatists, but it was a mistake that Obi-Wan and I were able to take advantage of.  -  Episode 3',
	'C-3PO: It couldn’t possibly be as bad as all that.  -  Episode 3',
	'C-3PO: Well, there, I agree with you. In fact, I could do with a tune-up myself.  -  Episode 3',
	'BAIL ORGANA: The end of Count Dooku will surely bring an end to this war, and an end to the Chancellor’s draconian security measures.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: I wish that were so, but the fighting is going to continue until General Grievous is spare parts . . . The Chancellor is very clear about that.  -  Episode 3',
	'BAIL ORGANA: I’ll do everything I can with the Senate.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Excuse me.  -  Episode 3',
	'BAIL ORGANA: Certainly.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: Oh, Anakin! Thank goodness, you’re back.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: I missed you, Padme. I’ve missed you so.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: There were whispers . . . that you’d been killed. I’ve been living with unbearable dread.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: I’m back, I’m all right. It feels like we’ve been apart for a lifetime. And it might have been ... If the Chancellor hadn’t been kidnapped. I don’t think they would have ever brought us back from the Outer Rim sieges.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: Wait, not here . . .  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Yes, here! I’m tired of all this deception. I don’t care if they know we’re married.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: Anakin, don’t say things like that. You’re important to the Republic ... to ending this war. I love you more than anything, but I won’t let you give up your life as a Jedi for me . . .  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: I’ve given my life to the Jedi order, but I’d only give up my life, for you.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: I wouldn’t like that. I wouldn’t like that one bit. Patience, my handsome Jedi . . . Come to me later.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Are you all right? You’re trembling. What’s going on?  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: I’m just excited to see you.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: That’s not it. I sense more . . . what is it?  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: Nothing . . . nothing . . .  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: You’re frightened. Tell me what’s going on!  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: You’ve been gone five months . . . it’s been very hard for me. I’ve never felt so alone. There’s . . .  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: . . . Is there someone else?  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: No! Why do you think that? Your jealousy upsets me so much, Anakin. I do nothing to betray you, yet you still don’t trust me. Nothing has changed.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: I’m afraid of losing you, Padme . . . that’s all.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: I will never stop loving you, Anakin. My only fear is losing you.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: It’s just that I’ve never seen you like this . . .  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: Something wonderful has happened.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: I’m . . . Annie, I’m pregnant.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: That’s . . . that’s wonderful.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: What are we going to do?  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: We’re not going to worry about anything right now, all right? This is a happy moment. The happiest moment of my life.  -  Episode 3',
	'SUPER BATTLE DROID G21: The planet is secure, sir. The population is under control.  -  Episode 3',
	'GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Good. Where is the Separatist Council?  -  Episode 3',
	'SUPER BATTLE DROID G21: This way, sir ...  -  Episode 3',
	'GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Yes, Lord Sidious.  -  Episode 3',
	'DARTH SlDIOUS: General Grievous, I suggest you move the Separatist leaders to Mustafar.  -  Episode 3',
	'GENERAL GRIEVOUS: It will be done, My Lord.  -  Episode 3',
	'DARTH SlDIOUS: The end of the war is near, General, and I promise you, victory is assured.  -  Episode 3',
	'GENERAL GRIEVOUS: But the loss of Count Dooku?  -  Episode 3',
	'DARTH SlDIOUS: His death was a necessary loss, which will ensure our victory. Soon I will have a new apprentice . . . one far younger and more powerful than Lord Tyranus.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: . . . every second I was thinking of you. Protecting the endless, nameless Outer Rim settlements became a torture . . . the battles were easy, the longing became unbearable . . . I’ve never been so happy as I am at this moment.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: Annie, I want to have our baby back home on Naboo. We could go to the lake country where no one would know . . . where we would be safe. I could go early-and fix up the baby’s room. I know the perfect spot, right by the gardens.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: You are so beautiful!  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: It’s only because I’m so in love . . .  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: No, it’s because I’m so in love with you.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: So love has blinded you?  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Well, that’s not exactly what I meant . . .  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: But it’s probably true!  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: I haven’t laughed in so long . . .  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: Neither have I.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: Anakin, help me! Help, Anakin! Anakin, I love you. I love you.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: Anakin??  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: What’s bothering you?  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Nothing . . .  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: I remember when I gave this to you.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: Anakin, how long is it going to take for us to be honest with each other?  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: It was a dream.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: Bad?  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Like the ones I used to have about my mother just before she died.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: And?  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: It was about you.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: Tell me.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: It was only a dream.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: You die in childbirth . . .  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: And the baby?  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: I don’t know.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: It was only a dream.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: . . . I won’t let this one become real, Padme.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: Anakin, this baby will change our lives. I doubt the Queen will continue to allow me to serve in the Senate, and if the Council discovers you are the father, you will be expelled from the Jedi Order.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: I know ….  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: Anakin, do you think Obi-Wan might be able to help us?  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Have you told him anything?  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: No, but he’s your mentor, your best friend . . . he must suspect something.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: He’s been a father to me, but he’s still on the Council. Don’t tell him anything!  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: I won’t, Anakin.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: I don’t need his help . . . Our baby is a blessing, not a problem.  -  Episode 3',
	'YODA: Premonitions . . . premonitions . . . Hmmmm . . . these visions you have . . .  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: They are of pain, suffering, death . . .  -  Episode 3',
	'YODA: Yourself you speak of, or someone you know?  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Someone . . .  -  Episode 3',
	'YODA: . . . close to you?  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Yes.  -  Episode 3',
	'YODA: Careful you must be when sensing the future, Anakin. The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: I won’t let these visions come true, Master Yoda.  -  Episode 3',
	'YODA: Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed, that is.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: What must I do, Master Yoda?  -  Episode 3',
	'YODA: Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: You missed the report on the Outer Rim sieges.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: I’m sorry, I was held up. I have no excuse.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: In short, they are going very well. Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos has moved his troops to Boz Pity.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: What’s wrong then?  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: The Senate is expected to vote more executive powers to the Chancellor today.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Well, that can only mean less deliberating and more action. Is that bad? It will make it easier for us to end this war.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Anakin, be careful of your friend Palpatine.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Be careful of what?  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: He has requested your presence.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: What for?  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: He would not say.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: He didn’t inform the Jedi Council? That’s unusual, isn’t it?  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: All of this is unusual, and it’s making me feel uneasy. You’re probably aware that relations between the Council and the Chancellor are stressed.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: I know the Council has grown wary of the Chancellor’s power, mine also for that matter. Aren’t we all working together to save the Republic? Why all this distrust?  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: The Force grows dark, Anakin, and we are all affected by it. Be wary of your feelings.  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: Anakin, this afternoon the Senate is going to call on me to take direct control of the Jedi Council.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: The Jedi will no longer report to the Senate?  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: They will report to me . . . personally. The Senate is too unfocused to conduct a war. This will bring a quick end to things.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: I agree, but the Jedi Council may not see it that way.  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: There are times when we must all endure adjustments to the constitution in the name of security.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: With all due respect, sir, the Council is in no mood for more constitutional amendments.  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: Thank you, my friend, but in this case I have no choice . . . this war must be won.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Everyone will agree on that.  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: Anakin, I’ve known you since you were a small boy. I have advised you over the years when I could ... I am very proud of your accomplishments. You have won many battles the Jedi Council thought were lost . . . and you saved my life. I hope you trust me, Anakin.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Of course.  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: I need your help, son.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: What do you mean?  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: I fear the Jedi. The Council keeps pushing for more control. They’re shrouded in secrecy and obsessed with maintaining their autonomy . . . ideals. I find simply incomprehensible in a democracy.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: I can assure you that the Jedi are dedicated to the values of the Republic, sir.  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: Nevertheless, their actions will speak more loudly than their words. I’m depending on you.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: For what? I don’t understand.  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: To be the eyes, ears, and voice of the Republic . . .  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: Anakin . . . I’m appointing you to be my personal representative on the Jedi Council.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Me? A Master? I am overwhelmed, sir, but the Council elects its own members. They will never accept this.  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: I think they will . . . they need you more than you know.  -  Episode 3',
	'BAIL ORGANA: Now that he has control of the Jedi Council, the Chancellor has appointed Governors to oversee all star systems in the Republic.  -  Episode 3',
	'FANG ZAR: When did this happen?  -  Episode 3',
	'BAIL ORGANA: The decree was posted this morning.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: Do you think he will dismantle the Senate?  -  Episode 3',
	'MON MOTHMA: Why bother? As a practical matter, the Senate no longer exists.  -  Episode 3',
	'GIDDEAN DANU: The constitution is in shreds. Amendment after amendment . . . executive directives, sometimes a dozen in one day.  -  Episode 3',
	'BAIL ORGANA: We can’t let a thousand years of democracy disappear without a fight.  -  Episode 3',
	'TERR TANEEL: What are you suggesting?  -  Episode 3',
	'BAIL ORGANA: I apologize. I didn’t mean to sound like a Separatist.  -  Episode 3',
	'MON MOTHMA: We are not Separatists trying to leave the Republic. We are loyalists, trying to preserve democracy in the Republic.  -  Episode 3',
	'BAIL ORGANA: It has become increasingly clear to many of us that the Chancellor has become an enemy of democracy.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: I can’t believe it has come to this! Chancellor Palpatine is one of my oldest advisors. He served as my Ambassador when I was Queen.  -  Episode 3',
	'GlDDEAN DANU: Senator, I fear you underestimate the amount of corruption that has taken hold in the Senate.  -  Episode 3',
	'MON MOTHMA: The Chancellor has played the Senators well. They know where the power lies, and they will do whatever it takes to share in it. Palpatine has become a dictator and we have helped him to do it.  -  Episode 3',
	'BAIL ORGANA: We can’t sit around debating any longer, we have decided to do what we can to stop it. Senator Mon Mothma and I are putting together an organization . . .  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: Say no more. Senator Organa. I understand. At this point, it’s better to leave some things unsaid.  -  Episode 3',
	'BAIL ORGANA: Yes. I agree and we must not discuss this with anyone, without everyone in this group agreeing.  -  Episode 3',
	'MON MOTHMA: That means those closest to you . . . even family ... no one can be told.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: Agreed.  -  Episode 3',
	'MACE: Anakin Skywalker, we have approved your appointment to the Council as the Chancellor’s personal representative.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: I will do my best to uphold the principles of the Jedi Order.  -  Episode 3',
	'YODA: Allow this appointment lightly, the Council does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: I understand.  -  Episode 3',
	'MACE: You are on this Council, but we do not grant you the rank of Master.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: What? ! How can you do this?? This is outrageous, it’s unfair . . . I’m more powerful than any of you. How can you be on the Council and not be a Master?  -  Episode 3',
	'MACE: Take a seat, young Skywalker.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Forgive me, Master.  -  Episode 3',
	'Kl-ADI-MUNDI: We have surveyed all systems in the Republic, and have found no sign of General Grievous.  -  Episode 3',
	'YODA: Hiding in the Outer Rim, Grievous is. The outlying systems, you must sweep.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: It may take some time . . . we do not have many ships to spare.  -  Episode 3',
	'MACE: We cannot take ships from the front line.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: And yet, it would be fatal for us to allow the droid armies to regroup.  -  Episode 3',
	'YODA: Master Kenobi, our spies contact, you must, and then wait.  -  Episode 3',
	'Kl-ADI-MUNDI: What about the droid attack on the Wookiees?  -  Episode 3',
	'MACE: It is critical we send an attack group there, immediately!  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: He’s right, that is a system we cannot afford to lose. It’s the main navigation route for the southwestern quadrant.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: I know that system well. It would take us little time to drive the droids off that planet.  -  Episode 3',
	'MACE: Skywalker, your assignment is here with the Chancellor, and Kenobi must find General Grievous.  -  Episode 3',
	'YODA: Go, I will. Good relations with the Wookiees, I have.  -  Episode 3',
	'MACE: It is settled then. Yoda will take a battalion of clones to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk. May the Force be with us all.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: What kind of nonsense is this, put me on the Council and not make me a Master!?? That’s never been done in the history of the Jedi. It’s insulting!  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Calm down, Anakin. You have been given a great honor. To be on the Council at your age . . . It’s never happened before. Listen to me, Anakin. The fact of the matter is you’re too close to the Chancellor. The Council doesn’t like it when he interferes in Jedi affairs.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: I swear to you, I didn’t ask to be put on the Council . . .  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: But it’s what you wanted! Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: That has nothing to do with this.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Anakin, regardless of how it happened, you find yourself in a delicate situation.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: You mean divided loyalties.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: I warned you there was tension between the Council and the Chancellor. I was very clear. Why didn’t you listen? You walked right into it.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: The Council is upset I’m the youngest to ever serve.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: No, it is not. Anakin, I worry when you speak of jealousy and pride. Those are not Jedi thoughts. They’re dangerous, dark thoughts.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Master, you of all people should have confidence in my abilities. I know where my loyalties lie.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: I hope so . . .  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: I sense there’s more to this talk than you’re saying.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Anakin, the only reason the Council has approved your appointment is because the Chancellor trusts you.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: And?  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Anakin, look, I am on your side. I didn’t want to see you put in this situation.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: What situation?  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: The Council wants you to report on all of the Chancellor’s dealings. They want to know what he’s up to.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: They want me to spy on the Chancellor? That’s treason!  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: We are at war, Anakin. The Jedi Council is sworn to uphold the principles of the Republic, even if the Chancellor does not.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Why didn’t the Council give me this assignment when we were in session?  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: This assignment is not to be on record. The Council asked me to approach you on this personally.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: The Chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan. He befriended me. He’s watched out for me ever since I arrived here.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: That is why you must help us, Anakin. Our allegiance is to the Senate, not to its leader who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Master, the Senate demanded that he stay longer.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin. Something is out of place.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: You’re asking me to do something against the Jedi Code. Against the Republic. Against a mentor . . . and a friend. That’s what’s out of place here. Why are you asking this of me?  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: The Council is asking you.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN : Anakin did not take to his assignment with much enthusiasm.  -  Episode 3',
	'YODA: Too much under the sway of the Chancellor, he is. Much anger there is in him. Too much pride in his powers.  -  Episode 3',
	'MACE: It’s very dangerous, putting them together. I don’t think the boy can handle it. I don’t trust him.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: He’ll be all right. I trust him with my life.  -  Episode 3',
	'MACE:I wish I did.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: With all due respect, Master, is he not the Chosen One? Is he not to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force?  -  Episode 3',
	'MACE: So the prophecy says.  -  Episode 3',
	'YODA: A prophecy . . . that misread could have been.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: He will not let me down. He never has.  -  Episode 3',
	'YODA: I hope right you are. And now destroy the Droid armies on Kashyyyk, I will. May the Force be with you.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: Thank you, Captain.  -  Episode 3',
	'CAPTAIN TYPHO: Rest well. My Lady.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: I’ll be up in a while.  -  Episode 3',
	'MOTEE: Yes, my lady.  -  Episode 3',
	'C-3PO: Is there anything I might do for you, my lady?  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: Yes, make sure all the security droids are working. Thank you, Threepio.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Beautiful, isn’t it?  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: You startled me.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: How are you feeling?  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: He keeps kicking.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: He?! Why do you think it’s a boy?  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: My motherly intuition.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Whoa! With a kick that strong, it’s got to be a girl.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: I heard about your appointment. Anakin. I’m so proud of you.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: I may be on the Council, but . . . they refused to accept me as a Jedi Master.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: Patience. In time, they will recognize your skills.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: They still treat me as if I were a Padawan learner. . . they fear my power, that’s the problem.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: Anakin . . .  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Sometimes, I wonder what’s happening to the Jedi Order . . . I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side?  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: What do you mean?  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists, and the Republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy?  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: I don’t believe that. And you’re sounding like a Separatist!  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: Anakin, this war represents a failure to listen . . . Now, you’re closer to the Chancellor than anyone. Please, please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Don’t ask me to do that, Padme. Make a motion in the Senate, where that kind of a request belongs. I’m not your errand boy. I’m not anyone’s errand boy!  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: What is it?  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Nothing.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: Don’t do this . . . don’t shut me out. Let me help you.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: You can’t help me . . . I’m trying to help you.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: I sense . . . there are things you are not telling me.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: I sense there are things you are not telling me.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: Hold me . . . like you did by the lake on Naboo, so long ago . . . when there was nothing but our love ... No politics, no plotting ... no war.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: You wanted to see me, Chancellor.  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: Yes, Anakin! Come closer. I have good news. Our Clone Intelligence Units have discovered the location of General Grievous. He is hiding in the Utapau system.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: At last, we’ll be able to capture that monster and end this war.  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: I would worry about the collective wisdom of the Council if they didn’t select you for this assignment. You are the best choice by far … but, they can’t always be trusted to do the right thing.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: They try.  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: Sit down, Leave us.  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: Anakin, you know I’m not able to rely on the Jedi Council. If they haven’t included you in their plot, they soon will.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: I’m not sure I understand.  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: You must sense what I have come to suspect . . . the Jedi Council want control of the Republic . . . they’re planning to betray me.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: I don’t think . . .  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: Anakin, search your feelings. You know, don’t you?  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: I know they don’t trust you . . .  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: Or the Senate . . . or the Republic . . . or democracy for that matter.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: I have to admit my trust in them has been shaken.  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: Why? They asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest, didn’t they?  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: They asked you to spy on me, didn’t they?  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: I don’t know ... I don’t know what to say.  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: Remember back to your early teachings. Anakin. "All those who gain power are afraid to lose it." Even the Jedi.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: The Jedi use their power for good.  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: Good is a point of view, Anakin. And the Jedi point of view is not the only valid one. The Dark Lords of the Sith believe in security and justice also, yet they are considered by the Jedi to be. . .  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: . . . evil.  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: . . . from a Jedi’s point of view. The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost every way, including their quest for greater power. The difference between the two is the Sith are not afraid of the dark side of the Force. That is why they are more powerful.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: The Sith rely on their passion for their strength. They think inward, only about themselves.  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: And the Jedi don’t?  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: The Jedi are selfless . . . they only care about others.  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: Or so you’ve been trained to believe. Why is it, then, that they have asked you to do something you feel is wrong?  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: I’m not sure it’s wrong.  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: Have they asked you to betray the Jedi code? The Constitution? A friendship? Your own values? Think. Consider their motives. Keep your mind clear of assumptions. The fear of losing power is a weakness of both the Jedi and the Sith.  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis "the wise"?  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: No.  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life ... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: He could actually save people from death?  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: What happened to him?  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: He became so powerful . . . the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Plagueis never saw it coming. It’s ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Is it possible to learn this power?  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: Not from a Jedi.  -  Episode 3',
	'Kl-ADI-MUNDI: Palpatine thinks General Grievous is on Utapau. We have had no reports of this from our agents.  -  Episode 3',
	'MACE: How could the Chancellor have come by this information and we know nothing about it? We have had contact with Baron Papanoida and he said no one was there.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: A partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet from the Chairman of Utapau.  -  Episode 3',
	'YODA: Act on this, we must. The capture of General Grievous will end this war. Quickly and decisively we should proceed.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Does everyone agree?  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: The Chancellor has requested that I lead the campaign.  -  Episode 3',
	'MACE: The Council will make up its own mind who is to go, not the Chancellor.  -  Episode 3',
	'Kl-ADI-MUNDI: Yes, this decision is ours to make.  -  Episode 3',
	'YODA: A Master is needed, with more experience.  -  Episode 3',
	'MACE: Given our resources, I recommend we send only one Jedi . . . Master Kenobi.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: He was not so successful the last time he met Grievous.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: No offense, my Master, but I’m only stating a fact.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Oh no, you’re quite right, but I do have the most experience with his ways of combat.  -  Episode 3',
	'YODA: Obi-Wan, my choice is.  -  Episode 3',
	'Kl-ADI-MUNDI: I concur. Master Kenobi should go.  -  Episode 3',
	'YODA: I agree.  -  Episode 3',
	'MACE: Very well. Council is adjourned.  -  Episode 3',
	'MACE: Obi-Wan, prepare two clone brigades as quickly as you can. If this report is true, there’s no telling how many battle droids he may have with him.  -  Episode 3',
	'CLONE COMMANDER GREE: The droids have started up their main power generators.  -  Episode 3',
	'YODA: Then now the time is, Commander.  -  Episode 3',
	'CLONE COMMANDER GREE: Yes, sir.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Has Anakin been to see you?  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: Several times . . . I was so happy to hear he was accepted on the Jedi Council.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: I know ... he deserves it. He is impatient, strong willed, very opinionated, but truly gifted.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: You’re not just here to say hello. Something is wrong, isn’t it?  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: You should be a Jedi, Padme.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: You’re not very good at hiding your feelings.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: It’s Anakin . . . He’s becoming moody and detached. He’s been put in a difficult position as the Chancellor’s representative . . . but I think it’s more than that. I was hoping he may have talked to you.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: Why would he talk to me about his work?  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Neither of you is very good at hiding your feelings either.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: Don’t give me that look.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: I know how he feels about you.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: What did he say?  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Nothing. He didn’t have to.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: I don’t know what you’re talking about.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: I know you both too well. I can see you two are in love. Padme, I’m worried about him.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: I fear your relationship has confused him. He’s changed considerably since we returned . . .  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Padme, I’m not telling the Council about any of this. I ... I hope I didn’t upset you. We’re all friends, I care about both of you . . .  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: Thank you, Obi-Wan.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Please do what you can to help him.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: We cannot let this turn into another war.  -  Episode 3',
	'BAIL ORGANA: Absolutely, that is the last thing we want.  -  Episode 3',
	'MON MOTHMA: We are hoping to form an alliance in the Senate to stop the Chancellor from further subverting the constitution, that’s all.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: I know a Jedi I feel it would be wise to consult.  -  Episode 3',
	'BANA BREEMU: That would be dangerous.  -  Episode 3',
	'MON MOTHMA: We don’t know where the Jedi stand in all this.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: I only wish to discuss this with one . . . one I trust.  -  Episode 3',
	'GiDDEAN DANU: Going against the Chancellor without the support of the Jedi is risky.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: The Jedi aren’t any happier with the situation than we are . . .  -  Episode 3',
	'CHI EEKWAY: Patience, Senator.  -  Episode 3',
	'FANG ZAR: We have so many Senators on our side, surely that will pursuade the Chancellor.  -  Episode 3',
	'BANA BREEMU: When you present the "petition of the two thousand" to the Chancellor, things may change.  -  Episode 3',
	'BAIL ORGANA: Let us see what we can accomplish in the Senate, before we include the Jedi.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: You’re going to need me on this one, Master.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Oh, I agree. However it may turn out just to be a wild bantha chase.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Master!  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Master, I’ve disappointed you. I have not been very appreciative of your training . . . I have been arrogant and I apologize . . . I’ve just been so frustrated with the Council. Your friendship means everything to me.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: You are strong and wise, Anakin, and I am very proud of you. I have trained you since you were a small boy. I have taught you everything I know. And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be, and you have saved my life more times than I can remember. But be patient, Anakin. It won’t be long before the Council makes you a Jedi Master.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Don’t worry. I have enough clones with me to take three systems the size of Utapau. I think I’ll be able to handle the situation . . . even without your help.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Well, there’s always a first time.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Obi-Wan, may the Force be with you.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Good-bye, old friend. May the Force be with you.  -  Episode 3',
	'CLONE COMMANDER CODY: Fortunately, most of the cities are concentrated on this small continent here . . . on the far side.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: I’ll keep them distracted until you get there. Just don’t take too long.  -  Episode 3',
	'CLONE COMMANDER CODY: Come on, boss, when have I ever let you down?  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Cato Nemoidia . . . for starters.  -  Episode 3',
	'CLONE COMMANDER CODY: That was Anakin who was late. I believe.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Very well, the burden is on me not to destroy all the droids before you get there.  -  Episode 3',
	'CLONE COMMANDER CODY: I’m counting on you.  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: Well, Anakin, did you see your friend off?  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: He will soon have Grievous’s head.  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: We can only hope the Council didn’t make a mistake.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: The Council was very sure in its decision.  -  Episode 3',
	'JAR JAR: Helloo Annie. Good en to see yousa . . .  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Hi, Jar Jar.  -  Episode 3',
	'JAR JAR: Oopsin da Chancellor!! So sorry, Your Highness, sir.  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: There are rumors in the Senate about Master Kenobi. Many believe he is not fit for this assignment.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Not fit? Why would anyone think that?  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: They say his mind has become fogged by the influence of a certain female Senator.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: That’s ridiculous. Who?!?  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: No one knows who she is ... only that she is a Senator.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: That’s impossible. I would know.  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: Sometimes the closest are the ones who cannot see.  -  Episode 3',
	'PALPATINE: Idle Senate gossip is rarely true and never accurate. I’m sure your Master will do fine.  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Save your energy.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: I can’t!  -  Episode 3',
	'OBI-WAN: Don’t give up, Padme. Don’t give up . . .  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: I sense someone familiar . . . Obi-Wan’s been here, hasn’t he?  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: He came by this morning.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: What did he want?  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: He’s worried about you.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: You told him about us, didn’t you?  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: He’s your best friend, Anakin. He says you’re under a lot of stress.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: And he’s not?  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: You have been moody lately.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: I’m not moody . . .  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: Anakin! Don’t do this again.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: I don’t know ... I feel . . . lost.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: Lost? What do you mean? You’re always so sure of yourself. I don’t understand.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Obi-Wan and the Council don’t trust me.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: They trust you with their lives. Obi-Wan loves you as a son.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: Something’s happening . . . I’m not the Jedi I should be. I am one of the most powerful Jedi, but I’m not satisfied ... I want more, and I know I shouldn’t.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: You expect too much of yourself.  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: I have found a way to save you.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: Save me?  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: From my nightmares.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: Is that what’s bothering you?  -  Episode 3',
	'ANAKIN: I won’t lose you, Padme.  -  Episode 3',
	'PADME: I’m not going to die in childbirth, Annie. I promise you.  -  Episode 3',
